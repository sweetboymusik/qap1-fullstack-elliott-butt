QAP1 - Full-Stack
Elliott Butt

1. 3-4 hours, mostly research on what modules/packages to use
2. NPM documentation and W3Schools + google and stackoverflow
3. No, I did not have to ask friends for help.
4. No I did not need to ask questions of my instructors.
5. Relatively simple. Funny enough, the word descriptions were the hardest part!
